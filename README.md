## About

I've done this Front-end Mentor exercise using React and Styled Components.

It has been the first time I have worked with styled components and although the magnitude of the project did not allow an optimal and scalable use of these, I have been able to learn their possibilities and structure.

I have also taken the opportunity to practice good practices such as separating logic either with utils or custom hooks.

The measures are a bit by eye because I have not used the premium function with the figma design and I had to rely on a png.
